# Guelph Attractions App

This is a simple Flutter application that displays different tourist attractions found around the City of Guelph. It shows users where to find these attractions, and how much they cost. Users can also schedule attractions that they want to visit, and create their own attractions locally. Overall, this project was a good medium sized project that allowed me to combine what I had learned in Flutter and push my limits.

## Purpose
- Practice Flutter animations
- Practice Flutter state managment systems such as Provider
- Learn good UI integrations

## Building the Project

- Run a phone simulator with XCode or Android Studio
- Navigate to the folder on a terminal
- Type: flutter run
