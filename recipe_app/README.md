# Recipe App

This is a simple Flutter application that displays different recipes that users might want to try. When the recipes are viewed, they display ingredients, cooking instructions, and a description. Users can also favorite recipes. Overall, this project was a good medium sized project that allowed me to combine what I had learned in Flutter and push my limits.

- Learn good UI integrations
